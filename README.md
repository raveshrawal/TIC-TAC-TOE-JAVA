🎮 Tic Tac Toe - Java Console Game
==================================

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Java for two players. This project runs in the console and is perfect for learning basic Java programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.

📌 Features
-----------

-   3x3 Tic Tac Toe board

-   Two-player turn-based gameplay (Player X and Player O)

-   Input validation (rejects already occupied cells)

-   Win condition checking (rows, columns, diagonals)

-   Clear board visualization in the console


🚀 Getting Started
------------------

✅ Prerequisites
---------------

-   Java JDK 8 or above

-   Terminal or any Java-supported IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)

🧠 How It Works
---------------

-   `printBoard()` prints the current state of the board after each turn.

-   `hasWon()` checks for winning conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

-   Main game loop:

    -   Prompts current player for input.

    -   Validates and places the move.

    -   Switches the player turn or announces the winner.
